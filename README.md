# python_crawler

Web crawling using Python is very easy because there are various libraries and its easiness to follow to achieve.

Initially I thought 'crawling' part was going to be the difficult part in web crawling, but using python made me not worry about it.

Here are twos ways I have tried:

#1. Using urlib

#2. Using scrapy
