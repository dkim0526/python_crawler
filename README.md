# python_crawler

Web crawling using Python is easy to follow because there are various libraries and its easiness to follow to achieve.

Here are three ways I have tried:
- 1. Using urlib
	- check crawler.py
- 2. Using scrapy
	- check crawler2.py
- 3. Using BeautifulSoup
	- check crawler3.py


Thing that I will crawl is going to be some reddit posts in reddit page in BlobkChain pages:
